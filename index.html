            <p>
                To my dearest Ukdicha ModakkküéÄ,
            </p>

            <p>
                Where do I even begin? Trying to capture everything that makes you so special feels like trying to catch
                starlight in a jar - it's just so much and so dazzling. But I'll try my best, because you deserve to
                know, truly know, how incredible you are.
            </p>

            <p>
                From the moment we connected, I was drawn to your warmth and openness. You're so easy to talk to, so
                relatable, and you have this amazing ability to make me feel seen and understood. It's like I can tell
                you anything, and you'll listen without judgment, offering your thoughtful insights and calming me down
                when my rants get a little out of hand (which you patiently endure, by the way!). Remember when I was
                going through [mention a specific situation where she supported you]? You were my rock, and I'll never
                forget that.
            </p>

            <p>
                You're not just a great listener; you're also incredibly smart. Your ICSE background shines through in
                your wit and intelligence. I love our conversations - they're always stimulating and full of laughter.
                And you're so mindful, always aware of the world around you and the people in it. "Consent is important
                bbg," you said, and that simple phrase just exemplifies your thoughtfulness and respect. It's one of the
                many things I admire about you.
            </p>

            <p>
                You have this infectious joy that lights up every room you enter. You're a true social butterfly,
                connecting with everyone you meet. But it's not just your social skills; it's your genuine care for
                others. You're kind, appreciative, and you have a huge heart. You notice the little things, and you make
                everyone around you feel special.
            </p>

            <p>
                And then there are your quirks, the things that make you uniquely *you*. Your clumsiness is actually
                quite endearing (just be careful, okay?). Your love for auto-rickshaw rides is adorable ‚Äì you find joy
                in the simplest things. And your passion for skating, even after your injuries, is inspiring. It shows
                your resilience and determination.
            </p>

            <p>
                You're beautiful, inside and out. Your hair smells like flowers, a detail I've noticed since the first
                time we met. And you have this radiant smile that can light up even the darkest day. You even have a
                forehead that's perfect for kisses, as you say!
            </p>

            <p>
                You're a Slytherin, through and through, with all the wit, ambition, and loyalty that comes with it. You
                love Harry Potter, SRK, romantic movies, and Shreeji's ice cream (since you were 7!). You have a soft
                spot for Polaroids and you find comfort in "Poorva Needs a Breakup." These little things, these
                passions, are part of what make you so wonderfully complex and interesting.
            </p>

            <p>
                ModakkküéÄ, you deserve all the love and happiness in the world. You're kind, smart, funny,
                beautiful, and so much more. You're truly special, and I'm so grateful to have you in my life.
            </p>

            <p>
                Happy Valentine's Day.
            </p>
